# Final Project 🎉🎉
This repository contains the final project I completed as part of my Bootcamp. Throughout this project, I applied the skills and knowledge I gained during the Bootcamp, including Python, Deep learning, and Generative AI. The project showcases my ability to develop an early detection/prediction of tomato diseases using image-recognition models and various data preprocessing and deep learning techniques.
